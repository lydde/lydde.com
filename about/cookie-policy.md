title: Cookie Policy
---
Just like many websites, lydde.com (and all our websites) uses cookies and related technologies to improve the way our site functions for visitors. It is up to you whether to accept cookies. If you want to opt out (that is, not allow cookies) at any time, all you need to do is change your browser settings.

## What are cookies and what do they do?
Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer, mobile device or tablet, for varying periods. They improve your browser experience, provide statistical analysis and advanced functions, simplify logging in and personalization, and are sometimes used for targeted advertising. Unless you are logging in (for example, to comment on a blog post) the cookies here are never used to identify you personally. We use cookies to compile statistical information and analyze how people use our website. This helps us provide more functionality and makes our site easier and better to use. There are two main types of cookies: “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.

Session cookies last only while you have your web browser open. Closing your web browser, erases the session cookies. This type of cookie helps the site to function correctly, for example, to expand and collapse menus, make the Lydde font appear properly on your screen, or save your work as your progress through a form.

Persistent cookies are also stored in your computer, and they will persist even after you close your browser. How long they persist depends on how they were first set up – the period can vary from minutes to years. Persistent cookies are used to store the preferences of your current visit, to be used for future visits (such as remembering your location or language preferences, your areas of interest, or other settings to customize your experience). They also help with statistics, analysis and advertising.

## Third party cookies for statistics and analysis
We use persistent cookies and related technologies from other companies that we work with, who then provide statistics that we can analyze to make our website better and provide our visitors with more of the content they want to see. The cookies from other companies are referred to as third-party cookies. Lydde does not control these third-party cookies or tracking technologies. The third-party cookies on our websites come from various companies, such as Google Analytics, Facebook and Microsoft.

## Third party cookies for retargeted advertising
Persistent cookies can also be used for advertising. We do not allow third-party advertisements on our websites, but we do advertise our products and solutions on other sites. Some of the sites on which we advertise may use persistent cookies. They use those cookies to store information about products and services in which you have shown an interest as you browse the web. The information from those cookies allows the third party site to display the most appropriate advertisements for you. In some cases, those cookies may lead to the third party site showing you our advertisements. Again, we do not control those third party cookies, and we encourage you to check the cookie policy of all the sites you visit. You can learn more about controlling cookie behaviour in the next section “Your choice – controlling cookies”.

## Your choice – controlling cookies
You can control how you use cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser. While the specific steps will depend on the browser you are using, most popular browsers allow you to either refuse all cookies, accept them only from trusted sites, or to accept cookies from the websites you are using at any particular time. In most browsers, you can find these settings under “Options” or “Preferences” or under the tool symbol. Many modern browsers also feature a private browsing mode, which temporarily overrides your normal settings.

Remember, if you do disable or delete cookies, you will not have access to the full functionality of our website. If you do not change your browser settings, we assume you accept our cookie use and privacy policy.

Some sites using persistent cookies relevant to our websites may be a part of a network that helps users manage their privacy. Two such networks, which give you simple tools to opt out from multiple sites are:

## Network Advertising Initiative
TRUSTe
Please note that opting out of retargeted advertising cookies will not stop sites from showing your advertisements – you will still see ads, but they will not be specifically targeted to you.

## Changes to this policy
We may, from time to time, make changes to this policy. We recommend that users of this website re-visit this policy regularly to check for changes.
